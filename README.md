# Trebolona Injection Script ðŸš€
-----This is my first GitHub project, so donâ€™t expect perfection ðŸ˜…-----
Only works on Debian/Ubunto based distros 
## Description

This script will **inject the Trebolona** into your system, optimizing it for performance and entertainment. Weâ€™re talking **gaming tweaks, NVIDIA drivers**, **Flatpak apps**, and of course, **background music to keep Tux pumped up** while running the show.
